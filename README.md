This project is a simple messenger that allows 2 persons to chat. 
Since it is just a demonstration of how we can use Java Sockets to develop a chat application, it does not have any GUI.
The application needs user to supply the port to be used for listening for input connections.
The current version makes connections to localhost only. However code can be easily changed to make connections to another instance of the application running on a different host.
